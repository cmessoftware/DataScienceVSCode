TODO:

* How should we install an ipython profile automatically?

* Check for `rpy2` and necessary `R` packages: `knitr` and others?

* Go over the startup .ipy scripts -- which imports are necessary?

* Profile installer script.

* Profile install / test script.

* Automated dependench checker: R, rpy2, knitr, other R packages?

* Import markdown code into ipython notebooks: in notebooks/stats191/oldslides.

  - Don't bother with: simple.Md, simple_diagnostics.Md, review.Md.

* Go through the exercise javascript.

* How do we integrate text and slides? Multiple views on the same notebook 
(maybe multiuser model?)

* Macro for run all above for slide mode / restart kernel as well. Test this
feature?
